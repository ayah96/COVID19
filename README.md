# Sentimental Analysis for Studying and analyzing the spreading of COVID-19 from Twitter data

We study and analyze the spreading of the COVID-19 epidemic based on the location and dates using datasets from Twitter.
Moreover, the study has done by performing sentiment analysis and making a correlation study between confirmed cases in a set
of countries and the sentimentâ€™s polarity value including negative and positive as well as a correlation between the number of
confirmed cases and number of tweets per country. Also, we have experimented with several machine learning classifiers including
Naive base, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression as well as RoBERTa model to predict the sentiment analysis on the
dataset. The experimental results show that Logistic Regression outperforms other classifiers with an accuracy of 0.86%, thus,
machine learning techniques could be used to study the sentiment of tweets which gives reasonable results.
